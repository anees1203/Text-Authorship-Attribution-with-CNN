# AuthorTrace: Text Authorship Attribution with CNN

## Project Description
AuthorTrace is a machine learning project designed to attribute authorship of text snippets using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This project uses TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub to train a 1D CNN to identify authors from their written content, focusing on text snippets sourced from CNN articles.
